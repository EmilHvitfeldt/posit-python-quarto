## Look at the help!

When starting out, its helpful to look at the help for every command.

```{bash}
quarto preview --help
```

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

:::{.callout-tip}
### Debugging Tips
1. Preview a single document `quarto preview somefile.qmd`
2. ` --log-level error` can help you focus on what is important
3. Delete the `_site` folder

## Tips for starting out

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
1. **Do not** create a new site from **scratch**
2. Find a website you like, and start editing it.  It's easiest to **learn by example.**
3. One of the best examples is the **[source code](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web) for the official Quarto docs**, since they demonstrate all of the features of Quarto!
:::

:::{.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
Learn to navigate the [Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/) website.

## Using VSCode

When authoring `_quarto.yml` or `.qmd` files, its best to use VSCode with the quarto extension.
